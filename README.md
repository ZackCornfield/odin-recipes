# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's **Foundations Course**, designed to practice fundamental HTML skills by creating a basic recipe website. The goal is to structure an HTML document correctly, link pages together, and lay the groundwork for more advanced styling and interactivity in future projects.

## Features

The website will include:

1. **Main Index Page**:
   - A central hub with links to individual recipe pages.
   - Simple navigation using unordered lists.

2. **Individual Recipe Pages**:
   - A heading with the recipe name.
   - An image of the dish.
   - A brief description.
   - An ingredients list.
   - Step-by-step instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Creating HTML boilerplate code for multiple pages.
- Structuring content with semantic HTML elements like headings, lists, and paragraphs.
- Using relative paths to link between pages.
- Organizing project files in a clear and logical directory structure.

## Future Improvements

While this project is focused on HTML, there is room for future enhancements:

- Adding CSS for styling to make the website visually appealing.
- Implementing JavaScript for interactivity, such as filtering recipes or dynamically updating content.
- Optimizing images for faster loading.

## Lessons Learned

By completing this project, I will gain confidence in:

- Applying HTML knowledge to build structured web pages.
- Setting up and managing repositories using Git and GitHub.
- Iteratively improving a project and reflecting on its growth over time.
